Rules can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19-DfXhC3Zjr_uquxoKINgTkIWiW_4aS8HgmQLivGTHk/edit

Changes:

	Nerf spam of older ship models

	Hard date limit on Healthcare reforms

	Disable Iberia (possible with the more stuff mod, which will be intgegrated later. Removes colonies if done this way)

	Disable Greater Grossdeutchland for Prussia (Germany+Austria+Hungary)

	Remove justifying on African Countries before Berlin Conference

	Add severe penalties for going beyond 30 infamy
	-Redone as of 01/07/2019
	
	Added penalties for forming Grossdeutchland as Prussia/Germany (These are removed gradually over 30 years)
	
	Added Balkanisation of Germany and possible reformation
	
	A number of countries can reclaim lost lands after getting dismantled, and can gain cores on them after reconquering them all back
	-These are; Britain (special case, can reconquer colonies but doesnt get cores on them), Russia, France, South America (with more stuff mod), Iberia (again with more stuff) and Scandinavia

Roadmap:

	Add PDM CBs

	Remove railroading (This one is long!)

	1gp ally only (This one is gonna be difficult, methinks)
